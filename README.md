# Sorting-Algorithms
This is the beautiful monotony of putting numbers in order
This Repository was meant to serve as a learning tool for python to familiarize myself with the general syntax as well as learn in-depth about different sorting algorithms. Different sorting algorithms have unique use cases that can make them more optimal and that is fascinating in the world of optimizing time-space complexity. Each file is a different type of sorting algorithm.
